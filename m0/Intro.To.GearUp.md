## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?
 - The video does a great job of describing how we cannot necessarily get away from our unconscious bias. The major reflection I have from the video is how we undermine ourselves and our lives if we succumb to our unconscious biases. We are less innovative, less open and less creative when we believe that we can always be objective. Recognizing the unconscious biases that occur in our lives enables us to open ourselves up more to the people around us. This also will create a better professional life as you can open your range of people you provide services for, build programs for, etc. 
* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
 - I worked as a director of a substance abuse facility and had clients from various walks of life. Encountering implicit biases was common as you initially have a sense of which clients would succeed and which clients would not. These biases were quickly shattered as people do not fit these biases. Over time, it become necessary to always check initial judgments as these can hinder people's treatment in how you operate with them. Implicit biases can be common in the healthcare industry and it's tragic because people's lives are on the line. 
* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?
 - I come from the 'helping' industry and will always be drawn to it. I imagine developing software at some point in time that helps connect people to more resources, making help and support more accessible. I have ideas for a "recovery" platform that could provide a lot of functionality in the field. In order to make the platform effective, understanding biases would be absolutely necessary. You could very easily develop a platform that only caters to a specific demographic if such biases go unchecked. Bringing in multiple developers and collaborating with a diverse group of content creators would be necessary in truly understanding how to best serve a wider range of individuals. 


#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?
 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort?
