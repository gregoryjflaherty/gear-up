## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?
 - The video does a great job of describing how we cannot necessarily get away from our unconscious bias. The major reflection I have from the video is how we undermine ourselves and our lives if we succumb to our unconscious biases. We are less innovative, less open and less creative when we believe that we can always be objective. Recognizing the unconscious biases that occur in our lives enables us to open ourselves up more to the people around us. This also will create a better professional life as you can open your range of people you provide services for, build programs for, etc. 
* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
 - I worked as a director of a substance abuse facility and had clients from various walks of life. Encountering implicit biases was common as you initially have a sense of which clients would succeed and which clients would not. These biases were quickly shattered as people do not fit these biases. Over time, it become necessary to always check initial judgments as these can hinder people's treatment in how you operate with them. Implicit biases can be common in the healthcare industry and it's tragic because people's lives are on the line. 
* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?
 - I come from the 'helping' industry and will always be drawn to it. I imagine developing software at some point in time that helps connect people to more resources, making help and support more accessible. I have ideas for a "recovery" platform that could provide a lot of functionality in the field. In order to make the platform effective, understanding biases would be absolutely necessary. You could very easily develop a platform that only caters to a specific demographic if such biases go unchecked. Bringing in multiple developers and collaborating with a diverse group of content creators would be necessary in truly understanding how to best serve a wider range of individuals. 


#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
- The element of my identity that I am most aware of at all times is the fact that I am in recovery for a substance use disorder. It has been a long time      that I have been in recovery but this aspect of my identity is something that I am aware of at all times. It has to be in order for me to survive. Every     decision I make, every place I go, every person I spend time with/interact with, is always being analyzed as to the role it plays in my recovery. All of these aspects in my life have to remain in line with my recovery in order for me to survive. Doing so also enables me to help others trying to achieve recovery as this is a huge part of my continous recovery. 
 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?
- This aspect of my identity gives me strength to survive tough situations, be resilient, and to constantly keep processing my thoughts and emotions. I believe this will help me at Turing survive tough moments while maintaining a positive and clear thought process. This part of my identity puts a strong emphasis on self-care which also will important to surviving the Turing experience. I believe this aspect of my identity has also enabled me to remain humble and open minded. 
 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
- I believe listening and giving space to everyone is key to bringing out their strengths at Turing. Contributing to a inclusive environment is beneficial to everyone as it fosters growth, change, creativity and prosperity. Keeping these values at the forefront always is key in everything I do as a student and classmate. I have advocated to include people in the past throughout my journey in recovery. The recovery community is big on inclusivity as no one is denied a seat. Including and reaching out to others in need played a major role in reaching personal recovery.  
 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort? 
 - I believe these strengths will enable me to open, humble and inclusive. I have been judged before and had biases brought against me because I am an individual in recovery. I would never want to impose that on someone else. My previous experiences have enabled me support people and do my best to encourage/motivate. I hope to be someone that can help foster and inclusive environment and provide support to as many people as possible. I believe we are all in this together and having such attitude will help everyone achieve success.
